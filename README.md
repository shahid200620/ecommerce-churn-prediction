## 🎯 Problem Statement

Customer churn is a major challenge in e-commerce platforms. Retaining existing customers is significantly more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

This project aims to:
- Analyze historical customer transaction behavior
- Engineer meaningful behavioral features
- Build and evaluate machine learning models
- Deploy an interactive application for churn analysis

## 🔒 Note on Data & Models

To follow **data privacy**, **security best practices**, and **repository size constraints**:

- Raw datasets are **excluded** from the public repository
- Trained model artifacts (`.pkl`) are **not uploaded**
- The deployed app uses **safe demo logic** to demonstrate workflows

This approach reflects **real-world ML deployment practices**, where sensitive data and models are not publicly exposed.
