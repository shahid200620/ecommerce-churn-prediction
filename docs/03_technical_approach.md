\# Technical Approach



\## Problem Type

This is a binary classification problem where the target variable indicates whether a customer churns or remains active.



\## Feature Engineering Strategy

\- RFM metrics (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)

\- Behavioral features (basket size, purchase intervals)

\- Temporal features (recent activity windows)



\## Model Strategy

Multiple machine learning algorithms will be trained and compared to identify the best-performing model:

\- Logistic Regression

\- Decision Tree

\- Random Forest

\- Gradient Boosting

\- Neural Network



\## Deployment Strategy

The final model will be deployed using a Streamlit web application for easy stakeholder access.
